# Kukuza Interface
An open source interface for the Kukuza DAO.

## Workflow for the Core Team

### 1. Structure and Projects
The Kukuza app v1 is organized in 14 different areas or epics. We use GitHub projects to organize the development of those epics. 
The project [User Story Mapping v1](https://github.com/Kukuza/kukuza-interface/projects/1) gives an overview and contains all user stories. Each column lists the stories for one of the 14 epics.

For the actual workflow, each of the 14 epics has its ownn Kanban board project with the following stages:
1. Refining Stories
2. Wireframing
3. Designing
4. Developing UIs
5. Integrating
6. Testing
7. Done
