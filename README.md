# Kukuza Interface
An open source interface for the Kukuza DAO.

## A. Workflow for the Core Team

### 1. Structure and Projects
The Kukuza app v1 is organized in 14 different areas or epics. We use GitHub projects to organize the development of those epics. 
The project [User Story Mapping v1](https://github.com/Kukuza/kukuza-interface/projects/1) gives an overview and contains all user stories. Each column lists the stories for one of the 14 epics.

For the actual workflow, each of the 14 epics has its ownn Kanban board project with the following stages:
1. Refining Stories
2. Wireframing
3. Designing
4. Developing UIs
5. Integrating
6. Testing
7. Done

### 2. Working with User Stories
- Development is driven by user stories.
- A user story is a GitHub issue labeled "story".
- User story issues evolve over time. E.g. designs (links and screenshots) will be added to the description.
- Each user story needs to be in 2 projects, the [User Story Mapping v1](https://github.com/Kukuza/kukuza-interface/projects/1) project and the respective Kanban project.
- During development, story issues will be moved through the Kanban board.
- Stories can only be in one Kanban colum at a time.
- Kanban columns reflect the current activitiy. Example: When the design for a story is in progress, the story should be in the column "3. Designing".
- Don't close story issues. Just reassign them and move them forward through the Kanban boards.
- Story issues can only be closed after successful testing by Product Management.

### 4. Backend Integration and APIs
- Most user stories need APIs to make them work.
- APIs are separate issues. They are not user stories. 
- Front end developers create issues, API requests, for the APIs they need. 
- API request issues need to be labeled "API" and assigned to all backend/smart contract developers.
- API requests can be created after the "2. Wireframing" stage (when a story is in "3. Designing").
