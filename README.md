# Kukuza Interface
An open source interface for the Kukuza DAO.

## Workflow for the Core Team

### 1. Structure and Projects
The Kukuza app v1 is organized in 14 different areas or epics. We use GitHub projects to organize the development of those epics. 
The project [User Story Mapping v1](https://github.com/Kukuza/kukuza-interface/projects/1) gives an overview and contains all user stories. Each column lists the stories for one of the 14 epics.

For the actual workflow, each of the 14 epics has its ownn Kanban board project with the following stages:
1. Refining Stories
2. Wireframing
3. Designing
4. Developing UIs
5. Integrating
6. Testing
7. Done


### 2. Working with User Stories
- Development is driven by user stories.
- A user story is a GitHub issue labeled "story".
- Each user story need to be in 2 projects, the (project) and the respective Kanban project. 
- During development, story issues will be moved through the Kanban board.
- They can only be in one Kanban colum at a time.
- Columns reflect the current activitiy. Example: When the design for a story is in progress, the story should be in the column "3. Designing".
- Don't close story issues. Just reassign story issues and move them forward through the Kanban boards.
- Story issues can only be closed after successful testing by Product Management.
